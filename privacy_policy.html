          <p>
            We appreciate you using Wecon! We respect your privacy concerns and
            value your trust and confidence in us. The following is a note of
            the information in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). This note
            is provided to assist you in navigating the Privacy Policy; it is
            not a substitute for reading the entire document! The following
            hyperlinks will take you directly to specific sections of the
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">ARE YOU COVERED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h5>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy only applies to you if you are a Wecon user who
            has registered by linking a mobile number that does utilize the +088
            international calling code.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">WECON REQUIRES WHAT INFORMATION FROM YOU?</h5>
          <p>
            We'll need your phone number and an alias when you sign up for a
            Wecon account. You can add more information to your profile and
            tweak it further. If you use specific WECON features (for example,
            publishing images to your Moments), we will use your information to
            deliver these features.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR DATA?</h5>
          <p>
            We use your information to deliver Wecon to you, so you may
            communicate with other users, use the features available on WeChat,
            and develop and maintain your WECON experience. If you are a parent
            or guardian who has given your kid permission to use WECON, we will
            keep the contact information you supplied so that we may verify any
            requests or inquiries you may have about your child's Wecon account.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>
          <p>
            We do not disclose your information with third parties unless we are
            required to do so by a court, government, or legislation. We only
            use these third-party services to process or store your data for the
            purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Any third party with whom
            we disclose user data is expected to protect user data to the same
            extent as our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>
          <p>
            The length of time we keep information varies depending on the type
            of information – for example, log-in data is kept for up to 90 days
            after it is obtained. We do not keep your personal information for
            any longer than is required by law.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">
            HOW CAN YOU EXERCISE YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS?
          </h5>
          <p>
            You may have particular rights over your data and how we can use it
            depending on where you reside. These options include how to access
            your data, erase it, limit how your data is used, object to our
            usage, and obtain a copy of your data.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">SECURITY IS OUR FIRST CONCERN</h5>
          <p>
            Wecon was built from the ground up to help you stay in touch with
            friends, communicate important information in the event of a natural
            disaster, reunite with estranged family members, and find a better
            life. We built end-to-end encryption into Wecon since it is used to
            share some of your most personal moments. End-to-end encryption
            prevents the interception of your messages, pictures, videos, voice
            conversations, documents, and phone calls.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">SAFE MASSAGE</h5>
          <p>
            When you use Wecon Messenger to send a message to another person,
            end-to-end encryption is employed. End-to-end encryption means that
            only you and the person with whom you're conversing can read or
            listen to what's sent, with no one else, including Wecon, in the
            middle. This is because your communications are locked with
            end-to-end encryption, and only the recipient and you have the
            specific key to unlock and read them. All of this happens
            automatically, so there's no need to change any settings or create
            specific hidden chats to keep your messages safe.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">Messages for Business</h5>
          <p>
            Every Wecon message is protected by the same Signal encryption
            protocol that secures messages before they leave your device. When
            you message a Wecon business account, your message is delivered
            securely to the destination chosen by the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wecon considers chats with businesses that use the Wecon Business
            app or manage and store customer messages themselves to be
            end-to-end encrypted. Once the message is received, it will be
            subject to the business’s own privacy practices. The business may
            designate a number of employees, or even other vendors, to process
            and respond to the message. You can always contact that business to
            learn more about its privacy practices.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">CONTROL IS ALL YOURS</h5>
          <p>
            Wecon wants to make sure you know what’s happening with your
            messages. If you don’t want to receive messages from a person or
            business, you can always block them directly from the chat or delete
            them from your contact list. We want to make sure you understand how
            your messages are being handled and have the options you need to
            make the right decisions for you.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mt-2 mb-3">HOW WILL WE INFORM YOU OF MODIFICATIONS?</h5>
          <p>
            If this Privacy Policy changes significantly, we will update it here
            and tell you before the change takes effect.
